note :

1.Design to implement on Fronten: https://invis.io/X610Y7APRPB7 - not let me in to inspect

2.DataBase - mySql 
  "CREATE DATABASE demo"  (check the application.properties)
  
3.port 8080  (e.g. http://localhost:8080)  

4.user to role many to many - not used yet from rule sys'



problems :

1.error for registration

2.when leave the app at employee list - when resatrt -yoou go to same url, and need to "logout"

3.when restart - all pass word dont work any more

4.to connect to dynamic model popup - need react

5.multi languages - react

6.validation not intearctive enough



second thought :

dto pattern

the annotation - not familiar with them enough
